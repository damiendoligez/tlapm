THEOREM Spec => []Safety
(* OK, how does one proof anything? -> go to online tutorial to look up basic proof structure

    actually, I was hoping for something like "A TLA+ Proof looks like this:...
    a little higher level than the "A simple proof" section on the TLA+ Proos System website
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 attempt 1:
    Let's just try writing OBVIOUS and see what happens...

 notes:
    - it took Damien to explain to me that I can't write anything under the `=========================`
++++++++++
OBVIOUS
*)


(*
  attempt 2:
    Attempt 1 didn't get us far, we'll have to be more sophisticated than that, so I'm scrolling down the online tutorial


     OK, it took me  a while to find the "the general form af a BY proof is : ...." on the
     website, but now I found it, so I'll use it...

   notes:
   - I find it un-intuitive, that I can't unfold WF_(vars) or WF like Spec etc...
+++++++++++
BY ConstantAssump DEF Spec, Safety
 *)

(*  attempt 3:
    Attempt 2 got me in an interactive mindset: I can see that I can interact with the proof state by looking and changing these obligations
    I played around with adding "Next" and "Init" to the list after "DEF".

    But logically it didn't get me anywhere, so I'll try something else:

    Ok, now I'm on the "Hierarchical proofs" section on the website, and it seems to tell me how to do an
    an implication elimination, which is a relief. It seems to be done by "suffices [..] assume [..] proof"

    notes:
    - I started out with the following code:
    <1> SUFFICES ASSUME Speck
                 PROVE []Safety

      I got a cryptic error message, it took Damien to explain that every step of a hierarchical proof needs to be closed by a "QED"-step with the same level

      I think the underlying problem there may be that in the online tutorial there are partial bits of code, which when copied and pasted give syntax errors.

    - Damien also pointed out I should be using the hyperbook ... That is referenced in the preamble to the online tutorial, but I skipped the preamble.
        I think there is a deeper problem there: all the documentation is very example-driven and very holistic in the sense that there is a lot of text and a lot of explaining.
        I'm in a goal-oriented mindest: I have a theorem, I want to prove it. What I'm really looking for are answers to
        questions like "How do I do implication elimination?" "How do I prove a box?" "What does the most basic syntactically correct hierarchical proof look like?", etc.
        So some sort of documentation that can be accesses in a demand-driven way, or a cheat-sheet with the most basic proof structures.

    - The way "QED" steps work is not intuitive, at least not yet...

     *)
<1> SUFFICES ASSUME Spec

    BY <1>1, LS4

   (* Side Notes:
    - it is annoying that the parser errors don't wrap around lines and I don't seem to be able to sort windows in the toolbox, so I can have them below the obligations... *)
