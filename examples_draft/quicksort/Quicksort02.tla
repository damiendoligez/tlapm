THEOREM Spec => []Safety


(* attempt 5:
    Right, how does one proof a box?

    Hypterbook 11.1 is very useful! it's a pity that it isn't self contained: I don't know what `Inv' is...
        I'll just try adding it as an undefined symbol and see what happens...

<1>1 Init => Inv
<1>2 Inv /\ [Next]_vars => Inv'
<1>3 Inv => Safety

<1>4 QED
        *)

(* attempt 6:
    right, that didn't work: now I'll have to go chase references in the hyperbook...

    reading Sec. 4.9.1 is helpful, let's try find an inductive invariant...

    It seems like Safety itself is a reasonable working hypothesis for an invariant for now...
 Let's try that plus TypeOK --
    can I define things in the middle of proofs?
        Inv == /\ TypeOK /\ Safety
    apparently not...

    Ok, now it's just under the definition of 'Safety'.
    Now when I go C-g C-g everything is yellow, but I get no interesting obligations... ?

    I'll try and get the QED green first...

   (* Side Notes:
    - It is annoying that the parser errors don't wrap around lines and I don't seem to be able to sort windows in the toolbox, so I can have them below the obligations...

    - I typed Ctrl-w (emacs-person that I am) and lost the text window somehow...

    - Why do I not get any interesting obligations, when typing C-g C-g in the following state:
