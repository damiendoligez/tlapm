(* A command is a shell command.  It is run with its stdin empty,
its stdout and stderr redirected to the same pipe (which is sent
to the PM's stdout).  The closing of this pipe indicates termination
of the process.

After the delay is expired, the function [tc] is called,
and it must tell what to do with the process: continue running it
(with a new delay and a new [tc] function) or kill it.

When the process terminates or is killed, the function [dc]
is called with the result of the process. Note that the exit code
of the process is not recorded because it is  not reliable under
Windows.  [dc] returns [true] for success (meaning that
the other commands of the task will not be run).

Note that all delays are counted from the launch of the process.
