<h2>TLA+: Lamport's specification language based on the Temporal Logic of Actions</h2>

<p><a href="http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html">TLA</a>
is a linear-time temporal logic introduced by Leslie Lamport in
<em>The Temporal Logic of Actions</em> (ACM TOPLAS 16(3), 1994,
872-923). Unlike other temporal logics, both systems and properties
are represented as logical formulas, and logical connectives such as
implication, conjunction, and existential quantification represent
structural relations such as refinement, parallel composition, and
hiding.</p>

<p>TLA+ is a language for specifying and verifying concurrent and distributed
systems. It is based on a variant of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory for describing
the data structures manipulated by the algorithms to be verified, and on TLA for
describing their dynamic behavior. TLA+ has been applied to numerous case
studies.
</p>

<p>This directory formalizes TLA+ in Isabelle (version 2021-1), as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
  <em>PredicateLogic</em> theory
  defines classical first-order logic as a basis for an encoding
  of TLA+. TLA+ is untyped, to the extent that it does not
  even distinguish between terms and formulas. We therefore
  declare a single type <em>c</em> that represents the universe of
  "constants" rather than introducing the traditional types <em>i</em> and
  <em>o</em> of first-order logic that, for example, underly Isabelle/ZF.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>SetTheory</em> defines the basic syntax and axiomatization of
  set theory.
  </li>

  <li>
  The <em>FixedPoints</em> theory develops the
  Knaster-Tarski theorems for least and greatest fixed points in the
  subset lattice. This development is used for the construction of
  integers; it also serves as a test for the encoding of TLA+
  set theory.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>Functions</em> theory: functions in TLA+ are not defined
  (e.g., as sets of pairs),
  but axiomatized, and in fact, pairs and tuples are later defined as
  functions. Incidentally, this approach helps us to identify functional
  values, and to automate the reasoning about them. This theory considers
  only unary functions; functions with multiple arguments are defined
  as functions over products.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>Integers</em> theory: the structure of integer numbers is introduced
  using an extended version of Peano's axioms. We prove the existence of a
  structure satisfying these axioms and define the integers as some such
  structure (using <em>CHOOSE</em> expressions), together with a subet of
  natural numbers. We define the successor and predecessor functions over
  integers and prove induction rules for natural numbers and integers.
  We also justify the definition of functions over integers by primitive
  recursion.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>IntegerArithmetic</em> theory: introduces addition (including
  subtraction) and multiplication over integers, as well as the order
  &lt;= over integers and <em>a &lt; b</em> (for arbitrary
  values) as <em>a &lt;= b &amp; a # b</em>. Proves many lemmas for
  integer arithmetic. Also defines intervals <em>m .. n</em> for
  integers <em>m</em> and <em>n</em>.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>IntegerDivision</em> theory: introduces integer division and
  modulus, as well as the divisibility relation. In accordance with
  the definition in the standard library of TLA+, <em>div</em> and
  <em>%</em> (modulus) are defined only if the second argument is a
  positive integer.

  <li>
  The <em>Tuples</em> theory defines tuples and relations in TLA+.
  Tuples are functions whose domains are intervals of the form
  <em>1 .. n</em>, for some natural number <em>n</em>, and relations are
  sets of tuples. This theory also introduces the notation <em>[x : S,
  y : T]</em> to denote the set of functions <em>f</em> with domain
  <em>{x,y}</em> such that <em>f[x] \in S</em> and <em>f[y] \in T</em>.

  <p>

  Finally, this theory introduces standard notions for binary
  relations, such as orderings, equivalence relations and so on.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>CaseExpressions</em> theory: reasoning about CASE expressions in
  TLA+.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>Strings</em> theory: encoding of characters and strings (written
  with two single quotes: ''string''). Characters are represented as
  pairs of hexadecimal numbers, strings are sequences of characters.

  <p>

  Records should be written as finite functions, e.g. <em>(''foo''
  :&gt; 1) @@ (''bar'' :&gt; TRUE)</em>, and sets of records can be
  written using the notation for sets of finite functions introduced
  in theory <em>Tuples</em>.
  </li>

</ul>

<p>

The theories are accompanied by two examples:

<ul>
  <li>
  <em>Allocator</em>:
  a case study for the specification and analysis of reactive systems
  in TLA+ . This theory contains some elementary invariant proofs over
  a specification that uses basic set theory.
  </li>

  <li>
  <em>AtomicBakeryG</em>:
  proof of type correctness and mutual exclusion for
  the well-known Bakery algorithm for <em>N</em> processes.
  </li>
</ul>
