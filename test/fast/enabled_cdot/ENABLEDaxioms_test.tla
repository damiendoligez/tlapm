(* This statement declares three variables. *)
VARIABLE x, y, z


P == x = 1  (* A state predicate. *)
A == x' = 1 /\ y' = 1  (* An action with primed variables. *)
B == z' = 1  (* Another action with primed variables, such that the set of
    primed variables of action A is disjoint from the set of primed variables
    of action B. *)
R == y' = 1 /\ x' = 1  (* An action equivalent to action A. *)

(* Proving that a state predicate can be moved outside the scope of ENABLED,
i.e., that from
    P \in BOOLEAN,
    A \in BOOLEAN,
    ENABLED (P /\ A),
    P is a state predicate
we deduce
    P /\ ENABLED A

The premises P \in BOOLEAN, A \in BOOLEAN, and ENABLED (P /\ A) must appear
as separate proof steps and listed in the BY statement where ENABLEDaxioms
appears. The premise that P is a state predicate is checked automatically by
TLAPS.

If the premises do not appear in this form, then the proof will not
succeed, because TLAPS checks the syntactic form of each premise, including the
levels of the expressions.

(* This theorem is similar to the previous one, with the difference that P
is a state predicate, instead of an action as A was. So the definition of P
does not contain any primed variables, thus its set of primed variables is
obviously disjoint from the set of primed variables of action B.
