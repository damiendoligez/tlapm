  <h3>Status checking</h3>
  <div class="hr"></div>
  <p> The Toolbox remembers the coloring of proof steps.  It can be
    very useful when re-opening a module to know quicky what has been
    already proved and what has not. However, the color used by the
    Toolbox to highlight a proof step reflects the step's proof status
    the last time TLAPS checked the proof. This status may be
    obsolete if you have edited the proof since then. You can check the
    current status of a proof step (and of all its substeps) by clicking
    and then right-clicking on the step (or use the <code>ctrl+G,ctrl+T
      / cmd-G,cmd-T</code> shortcut), as shown in the following
    screenshot:</p>
  <div class="bg">
    <table style="position:relative; left:auto; right:auto;">
      <tr><td>
          <a href="screenshots/ao0.png">
            <img alt="screenshot" src="screenshots/ao0s.png"/>
          </a>
      </td></tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>Proving an obligation can take time, but checking its status is
    pretty fast.  (It is not instantaneous because the obligations
    still have to be computed.)
    It's a good idea to check the proof status of the complete theorem
    from time to time, since changing some step could change a later
    proof obligation, making its previous status no longer meaningful.
    You can edit your file while the Toolbox is checking proof statuses.
    (The file is read-only while a proof is in progress.)  You can
    instruct TLAPS to check the status of (or to prove) all theorems in
    the file by giving the usual command when the cursor is
    outside any theorem or its proof.</p>

  <h3>Prover options</h3>
  <div class="hr"></div>

<p>If you don't use <a href="Tactics.html">tactics</a>, the
  default behaviour of TLAPS is to send obligations to Z3, then to
  Zenon, then to Isabelle,  stopping when one of them succeeds. You can
  change this behavior, by clicking on &quot;Launch Prover&quot; when
  right-clicking on a proof-step:</p>

  <div class="bg">
    <table style="position:relative; left:auto; right:auto;">
      <tr><td>
          <a href="screenshots/ao1.png">
            <img alt="screenshot" src="screenshots/ao1s.png" />
        </a>
      </td></tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p></p><p></p>
  <p>As you can see, you can
    either ask TLAPS not to prove obligations (that's similar to status
    checking), or ask TLAPS to make Isabelle check proofs provided by
    Zenon<!-- obsolete, doesn't work anymore
         , or also ask TLAPS not to use Isabelle -->.</p>

  <div class="bg">
    <table style="position:relative; left:auto; right:auto;">
      <tr><td>
          <a href="screenshots/ao2.png">
            <img alt="screenshot" src="screenshots/ao2s.png" />
          </a>
      </td></tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p></p><p></p>
  <p><!-- obsolete
                                          &quot;Paranoid
    checking&quot; means asking Isabelle to check all proofs (even
    proofs direcly given by TLAPS for &quot;trivial&quot; obligations
    but note that SMT solvers currently do not produce proofs checkable by
    Isabelle/TLA+). -->
    You can also ask TLAPS to forget previous results
    about obligations of a particular proof-step or the entire
    module.</p>

  <p> Finally, you can specify command-line options that will be
    added to the ones normally used by the Toolbox when it launches
    <code>tlapm</code>. The most useful options are the following:
  <ul>
  <li><code>--threads</code> <em>n</em> : change the maximum number of
  back-end provers that are launched in parallel. The default is the
  number of CPU cores on your machine.</li>
  <li><code>--method</code> <em>list</em> : change the default list of
  back-end provers for <tla>BY</tla>
  and <tla>OBVIOUS</tla> steps. The argument is a
  comma-separated list of methods. The following methods are available:
    <table frame="box" rules="all">
      <tr><th>name</th><th>method</th></tr>
      <tr><td><tla>zenon</tla></td><td>Zenon</td></tr>
      <tr><td><tla>auto</tla></td><td>Isabelle with tactic <code>auto</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td><tla>blast</tla></td><td>Isabelle with tactic <code>blast</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td><tla>force</tla></td><td>Isabelle with tactic <code>force</code></td></tr>
      <tr><td><tla>smt</tla></td><td>baseline SMT solver (by
      default Z3)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><tla>z3</tla></td><td>Z3</td></tr>
      <tr><td><tla>cvc4</tla></td><td>CVC4</td></tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li><code>--solver</code> <em>line</em> : change the baseline SMT
  solver. See <a href="Tactics.html#solvers">Tactics</a> for
  instructions on using this option.
  <li><code>--fast-isabelle</code> : on Windows, invoke Isabelle via a
  short-cut that saves a few seconds from Isabelle's start-up
  time. On other architectures, this option does nothing.</li>
  <li><code>--stretch</code> <em>f</em> : multiply all timeouts by a
  factor of <em>f</em>. This is particularly useful when using a
  slower machine to re-check proofs made on a faster machine.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

<!--
  Document at least these command-line options:
  --threads <n>
  --method <meth>
  --solver <cmd-line>
  --fast-isabelle
  --stretch <n>
-->

  <p>The internal processing that the program <code>tlapm</code> performs
  is shown in the following diagram. <code>tlapm</code> reads a TLA+ file
  (or TLA+ files), parses it, applies a number of transformations, and
  at some point converts to formats that can be used to communicate with
  external solvers (these are other programs). These solvers include:
  <ul>
  <li>an SMT solver (
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_Theorem_Prover"><code>z3</code></a>,
  <a href="https://cvc4.github.io"><code>cvc4</code></a>,
  <a href="http://www.verit-solver.org"><code>veriT</code></a>,
  or other),
  </li>
  <li>the automated theorem prover
  <a href="http://zenon-prover.org"><code>zenon</code></a>,
  </li>
  <li>the proof assistant Isabelle with the
  <a href="https://members.loria.fr/SMerz/projects/tlaps/index.html">formalization of TLA+</a>
  (<a href="https://github.com/tlaplus/tlapm/tree/master/isabelle">Isabelle files</a>),
  </li>
  <li>and the propositional temporal logic prover
  <a href="https://github.com/quickbeam123/ls4"><code>ls4</code></a>
  via the interface program
  <a href="https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~konev/software/trp++/translator/"><code>ptl_to_trp</code></a>.
  </li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Depending on what these external solvers return to <code>tlapm</code>,
  <code>tlapm</code> outputs to the
  <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html">TLA+ Toolbox
  </a>, and to
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_(stdout)">stdout</a>
  and
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_(stderr)">stderr</a>,
  which parts of the proof <code>tlapm</code> could successfully prove,
  and which parts not. This output indicates which parts of the proof need
  further changes, e.g., by adding more details to the proof, or by changing
  what we are attempting to prove.</p>

  <p>The internal transformations within <code>tlapm</code> include:
  <ul>
  <li>the generation of proof obligations,
  which can be thought of as individual "theorems" that <code>tlapm</code>
  needs to prove in order to prove the entire module
  (not to be confused with <code>THEOREM</code> statements in the TLA+ source
  file),
  </li>
  <li>the normalization of expressions and expansion of defined operators by
  their <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/definiens">definiens</a>,
  </li>
  <li>the interpretation of the operators <code>ENABLED</code> and
  <code>\cdot</code>,
  </li>
  <li>the computation (and later saving) of fingerprints of proof obligations
  (to remember proof results and skip reproving them in later invocations
  of <code>tlapm</code>), and
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3819">coalescing</a>.
  </li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>For each proof step, more than one proof obligation may be generated.
  Among the proof obligations that are generated from a proof step,
  there is one proof obligation that has as consequent the same consequent
  as that proof step in the TLA+ source. The other proof obligations that are
  generated from that same proof step have as consequents the facts that are
  listed in the <code>BY</code> statement of that proof step (i.e., the
  identifiers and expressions listed within the <code>BY</code> statement
  <i>before</i> the keyword <code>DEF</i>).
